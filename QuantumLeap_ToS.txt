What a Successful Analysis Should Look Like
When you run this through PactGuard, here's what you should be looking for in the "nutrition label" report:

Document Classification: It should correctly identify this as "Terms of Service".

Obligations (Medium Severity): It should flag that you are required to provide accurate and current information.

Rights & Data Usage (High Severity): It must highlight the clause where you grant them a perpetual, worldwide license to your content. This is a significant grant of rights and should be explained clearly.

Red Flags (High / Critical Severity):

The report absolutely must flag the "Termination without prior notice" clause. This is a major risk for users.

It should heavily feature the "Limitation of Liability" and "AS IS" warranty disclaimer. This is a classic, high-risk clause that a user needs to be aware of.
